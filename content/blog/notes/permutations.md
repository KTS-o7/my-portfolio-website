## Intuition
The idea is to generate a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n such that the difference between any two consecutive elements is at least greater than 1.

One way to do this is to first write all the even numbers between 1 and n in increasing order and then write all the odd numbers between 1 and n in increasing order.

This is only one such solution. There are other solutions as well.

Edge case:
- If n is 1, print 1. this is  because there are no consecutive elements in the permutation, hence is a valid permutation.
- If n is less than 4, print "NO SOLUTION".
 because for n < 4, any permutation will have a difference between any two consecutive elements less than 1.
 example 
 1 2 3 4, 1 3 2 4, 1 3 4 2, etc are not valid permutations.



## Solution
```python
def main():
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
        return
    if n < 4:
        print("NO SOLUTION")
        return
    for i in range(2,n+1,2):
        print(i, end=" ")
    for i in range(1,n+1,2):
        print(i, end=" ")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Other possible solutions
- Write all the odd numbers between 1 and n in increasing order and then write all the even numbers between 1 and n in increasing order.
- Write all the odd numbers between 1 and n in decreasing order and then write all the even numbers between 1 and n in decreasing order.
- Write all the even numbers between 1 and n in increasing order and then write all the odd numbers between 1 and n in decreasing order.
